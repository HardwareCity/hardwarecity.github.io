We extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who joined us at "Ol√° Ria Restaurante" for the launch of our very first Hardware City Session! It was an evening full of insights, discussions, and a shared passion for product development within the hardware industry.

Hardware City Sessions serve as informal yet impactful gatherings designed to navigate the intricate journey from product inception through industrialization to successful commercialization. These sessions facilitate open dialogues, featuring industry guests who share their expertise through brief talks followed by engaging Q&A sessions.

Our inaugural event set the stage for an enriching community centered around discussions on product development, particularly within the hardware domain. Entrepreneurs, industrialists, market experts, and hardware/software developers converged to delve into topics spanning robotics, IoT, additive printing, general electronics, and beyond.

At the heart of this discussion was Carlos Alves, the esteemed administrator and founder of HFA, a leading national electronics assembly firm. His valuable insights and experiences illuminated the pathway for all present, offering a glimpse into the intricacies and successes of hardware entrepreneurship.

The aim of Hardware City Sessions is to foster a collaborative environment where seasoned entrepreneurs share their journeys, guiding those embarking on similar paths. Moreover, these sessions serve as a vital hub for professionals across various industrial sectors to explore the world of startups and converge on innovative hardware solutions.
