## Hardware City Session #7
Terça-feira, 28 de março de 2017, 20h45
Centro Cultural e de Congressos

Descrição:
We're back again and with another awesome session! This time, we wanted to do something really special, so we decided to create a panel full of women! Yeah, we know that this kind of area can be dominated by men, but we also know that even though women are not the minority, they can do it better - or at least as well as men do - don't kick us! We can't wait to introduce you all our speakers!

Discussão:
We’re back again and with another awesome session! This time, we wanted to do something really special, so we decided to create a panel full of women:
- Susana Sargento
- Mónica Pedro
- Andreia Abreu
We think we have much to learn from their experiences. So don't miss out!
