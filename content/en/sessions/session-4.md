## Hardware City Session #4

Terça-feira, 31 de maio de 2016, 20h45
Centro Cultural e de Congressos de Aveiro

Descrição: The next HARDWARE CITY SESSION edition will be held within the EUROPEAN MAKER WEEK.
You can register for free here: http://events.europeanmakerweek.eu/events/view/464
We are preparing something Huge for you!
This time around, the discussion will focus on the Maker Community and FabLabs. For that purpose we will be featuring 4 Great Guests explaining the concept, and talking about how to take advantage of Fablabs. You’ll be hearing about experts sharing their experience on Productization: extraordinary people who build products from scratch.
We don’t want to uncover everything at this time (spoiler: drones coff coff), but it will be a heck of a Session. Also there will be a Digital Fabrication crash course during the session.
So bookmark the date 31 May 2016 and Stay tuned for more updates on the our Guests.
Also, if you’re a Maker, and would like to show us what you’re doing, please come and show us what you’ve been working on. We’ll have a room for people to show off their works and exchange opinions with others. Register here: https://goo.gl/4dNfoN
If you can't attend the event you can watch the Live video.

Discussão:
Introducing our first Guest for Session #4: Luís Carvão
Luís Carvão is incredibly passionate about technology and creativity. He completed his master degree in architecture at ISCTE-IUL in 2011 and joined the FabLab EDP team allowing his and since then my geeky/creative abilities were able to flourish.
In 2013 he volunteered to become a FabAcademy graduate and ended up becoming a remote instructor for the largest distributed online teaching academy with over two hundred students. Nowadays he owns a company named “open3Dge” which handles the training area as well as the automated machine making area for small industries.

António Gonçalves: Our third HARDWARE CITY Session #4 Guest
António holds a Degree on Physics by Coimbra University, a master in Physics Education by Lisbon University, and a DEA on eLearning by Barcelona Open University. He is particularly interested in cooperative and collaborative open projects, informal learning, at the moment he is the “LAB Aberto” coordinator.
“LAB Aberto” is a mini FAB LAB at Torres Vedras, an active partner of the FAB LAB portuguese network. We have an informal community of volunteer members that work in several projects: modeling and 3D printing learning, PLOTTER, ROVER, DRONE, Lallement bike, a bike mobile FAB LAB and an Educational Game about atoms and workshops about digital fabrication and ARDUINO programming.
Antonio will be presenting a DRONE based project: – the PLOTTER – and a WS on Modelling and 3D Printing

Our final Guest for this session will be: Severino Raposo
Severino holds a degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from the University of Aveiro, and has since then, been working on several hardware related projects, such as:
ADS – An electrical data acquisition system for Arch Welding (TIG, MIG/MAG etc.)
ADRS – Data Monitoring System for Resistance Welding
RR365 – Electronic design watch with old Nixie-Type valves.
GPSPigeonTrainer – A GPS based system for pigeon training [Far Away Sensing]
He currently develops and organizes the DRONE project (Quadricoptero) LAB Open, and is the author of the ALIV project, a UAV flight vehicle with effective horizontal and vertical landing! How cool is that?
